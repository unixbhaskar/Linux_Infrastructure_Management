# Monitoring Infrastructure
Building the infrastructure is fine, but we need to monitor it constantly for the status and it's health. So, we can take decision on the basis of that report. And sometime we will introduce some strategy to take decision upon the status we received. Many enterprise deploy different kind of tools to measure those status and take decision out of that reports . But, at least few them generate or prone to produce some false alarm and reports based on that. So, we need to eliminate those "false positive" from the actual reports to streamlined the decision making process.

Lets get our discussion absolutely to the point , by which I mean , lets talk about some tools ,which are deployed across the enterprises . As I believe and use and advocate to use free and open source software everywhere, plus I am more accustomed with that pattern of open source; you can expect lots of suggestion based out of the information and hands on things. On the side effect of this people has to have the clear cut idea of customizing the software according to their infrastructure's need. Now, how do you arrest the "false positives"?? There are methods available to distinguish the actual positive from the false one. One has to be keen enough to find the details and specification aware ,so it will be easy thing to deduce the fact from the result. 

Now, what to monitor? I have had been an environment where I saw people monitor everything ( seeing those I conclude that they just don't understand what they need to know) , and into some environment ,where everything is very precious , which means they know ; what exactly needed. In the second case, you are better off with eliminating lots of unnecessary noise. Knowing what you need is a big steps, in every aspect of life. Likewise , in enterprise infrastructure monitoring ; things to be monitored should very precisely described and documented.

There is no hide and seek for my liking ; I like Nagios a lot. Why? partly because of it's flexible nature and easy customization and modularity . Of course , a great community support. And I did lots of hand on stuff with it for one of my engagement with a corporation. By which I came to know lot of intricacies of it's working and liking and disliking. But as I said earlier that some of the tools are prone to false alarm , and unfortunately Nagios is one of them. I personally ,tried to figure out doing lots of checking by hand ; because I was exposed to it, just to make sure that the result I am seeing is correct and coming from right places.
