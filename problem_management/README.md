# Problem Management
This is the chapter that will make you aware of how problem-related to infrastructure can be handled and mitigated inefficient way.

 I am the kind of person, who doesn't believe in stories but believes in what is actually happening/happen thing. And strongly believe living with a bunch of people all the time that they give more "black and white" picture then distorted thing with some colorful stories. It saves my time and them too.

 So, in a broader sense, the problem comes in a bunch and go away with a
 bunch, yep general rule of life. But, in BU, the problem can be categorized
 in different forms i.e. genuine problem, created problem, arse saving problem, incompetency guard problem et al. Frankly I am not at all interested in others but the first one. Unfortunately, you have to deal with others, whether you like it or not, and need to take some really drastic steps to eliminate other kinds of "cosmetic" problems from your life and focus on the main problem.

 Now for instance, as I have had into the BU's infra for some organization, so I can vouch, an emergency can come once in a month or bi-monthly, and you can deal with it. But if it's started to come frequently than those intervals, then two things should come to your mind. One, the infrastructure needs a serious kind of lookup in a quick time but rigorous. Second, need to evaluate the guys are operating or managing it. No other go I believe, you just can not sit on it for long. It might explode on some undesirable time and make you look a fool. So, long story short, pro-activeness is highly desirable. We generally are good at re-activeness.

Now, when you manage a team, you need to split up things as important and urgent, everybody does something special. I would prefer to do the urgent or assign someone in the team, who I can believe accomplish the task without much fuss and the important thing has to be distributed with others along with proper eta. Sound familiar? Bound to be! That's the way it works most of the places. Plus, on top of that, I would preferably have someone to document the process if something new has come up. Being in charge of a team of any size, you need to understand whom to give what, pretty ordinary thing; easily figure able. By means, I need to convey that distributing the ownership between the members.

So, basically I make people accountable for what they are doing and also make sure they get due credit what they are doing. It will certainly boost their morale in turn bring more productivity and a sense of responsibility. When you bestowed with that kind of honor, chances will be high to gain more than to lose.

Okay, different matrix has to take into account of solving the problem related
to infrastructure. I will nail down to a few, absolutely necessary ones. Just trying to eliminate noise from the actual fact. I have had seen a bottleneck in problem-solving place, that too many levels of approval need to such a trivial and insignificant job. Sometimes it really irritates me that, little bigger organization put so much layer which is not at all necessary to the system work properly. And they create more noise, which is quite distracting. As I said above, a few good tools will make the infrastructure stable along with some sensible folks. If the human is not trained enough, it's the duty of the leader to pour in some good information into the human, so they do not have any illusion to work on that environment and become productive in quick time. Although I have had seen most the "Manager" failed to do that in an alarming way. They just do the wrong thing for the right reason.

I am pretty okay with few bumps, that's fine and that's alerts you way ahead of time, so you can take precaution. But I am not sure how that can be measured, because every situation is different and the way to solve the problem would be quite different too (although the basic rely on the same, solving the problem). Educating team members is of ultimate importance. The more informed they are, the more they perform well.
